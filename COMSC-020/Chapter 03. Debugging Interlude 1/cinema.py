#
#   Your program will repeatedly ask for a day of the week
#   where 1 = Monday and 7 = Sunday
#
#   It will then ask for an hour of the day (0-23)
#   It then displays a price for a movie ticket, based on the
#   following table:
#
#   Monday and Wednesday all day: $5.00
#   All other days before 1 p.m.: $6.00
#   All other times and days: $8.00
#   Hint: if/elif/....
#
#   After printing the ticket price, it will ask if you want to
#   keep going.
#
#   Your program must make sure that the day is from 1-7 and that
#   the hour is from 0-23. Hint: write a get_day() and get_hour()
#   function. Each of these functions will have a while loop to make
#   sure that input is OK.
