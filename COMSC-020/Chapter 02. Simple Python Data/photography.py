# Professional photographers need to set the focus distance
# so that the entire object they are taking a picture of
# (the subject) is in focus.
#
# They use a formula based on the distance to the nearest
# part of the object (let's call it near distance) and
# the distance to the farthest part of the object
# (let's call it far distance). The formula for the subject focus
# distance is:
#
#   2 * near distance * far distance / (near distance + far distance)
#
# So, for example, if you wanted to take a picture where the nearest
# part of the object was 3 meters away and the farthest part was 5
# meters away, the subject focus distance would be 2 * 3 * 5 / (3 + 5),
# or 3.75 meters.
#
# Here is the plan:
# Ask for the near distance
# Ask for the far distance
# Calculate subject focus as
#   (2 * near distance * far distance) / (near distance + far distance)
# Display the subject focus, properly labeled.
#
# Remember: when you translate this plan to Python, you can't put spaces in
# the names of your variables.
