# If you are wrapping a rectangular box in paper, what is the required
# surface area if there's a 5% overlap?
#
# 1) Ask for the length of the box
# 2) Ask for the width of the box
# 3) Ask for the height of the box
# 4) Calculate the area without overlap as:
#    2 * ((length * width) + (length * height) + (width * height))
# 5) Calculate the area with overlap as 1.05 times the area without overlap.
# 6) Display the area with overlap, properly labeled.
#
# You may choose any unit of measurement for the dimensions that you like (inches,
# centimeters, whatever).
