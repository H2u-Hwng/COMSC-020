# Break-even point

#
# The break-even volume is the amount of a product a business
# must produce in order to recoup the costs of production.
#
# The formula (from
# https://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/wholefarm/html/c5-201.html) is:
#
# Break-Even Volume = Fixed Costs / (Sales Price â€“ Variable Cost Per Unit)
#
# Definitions from https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/bookkeeping/7-accounting-formulas-every-business-should-know/
#
# [The formula on that page is wrong, by the way]
#
# Fixed Costs are recurring, predictable costs that you must pay
# in order to conduct business. These costs include insurance premiums, rent,
# employee salaries, etc.
#
# Sales Price is the retail price you sell your products or services for.
#
# Variable Cost Per Unit is the amount it costs you to make your product.
#
# Your program will ask the user for the fixed costs, sales price, and variable
# cost per unit. It will then calculate and print the break-even volume, properly
# labeled.
